# My dev section

Repository to store some of my code.
Most projects are for academic pourposes, but you'll also find personal studies or projects. The most important directories are listed below:

---

## C++

One of my favourites. It stores from a machine learning snake ai game project to a 3d rendering engine. There's also some work with OpenGL.

3D Rendering engine using only SDL2. It's located at `cpp/sdl2/3drendering`. You can compile it with `make points_to_line` and run with `./bin/points_to_line`. It's still a work in progess and for now there's not really much to do yet, but it's still fun to play with the geometric transformation.  

## C

One of the largets of them. It stores everything from university exercices and lists such as `/icc1` and `/lab-icc1`, my personal codeforces solution sets, to personal projects and studies, often on the  `/study` and `/thrown` directories.

You can find this donut on the `c/study/render/donut.c`. To run it, you can compile it with `lm` flag for the `math.h` lib, eg: `gcc donut.c -lm`. Note: **It doesn't work on windows.**

## POO

Set to store data from the discipline SSC0103 - Programação Orientada a Objetos, which includes the fundamentals of OOP programming in Java and Python 3. 

## Codelab section

Stores all files for the Codelab classes and exercices.
